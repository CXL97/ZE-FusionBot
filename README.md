## INTRODUCTION

`ZE FusionBot` is a robust, open-source SysBot.NET fork originally meant specifically for the Discord server, [Zeraora's Emporium](https://FreeMons.Org), hence the 'ZE' in the name. It was originally meant to satisfy the personal needs of the bot owners running exclusively in the server, but it slowly evolved into a beautiful custom GUI that mixes logic from many developers.

This bot unites the forks of various other developers - some new, some old, some advanced, some only beginning, and it adds to it, making it now a massively combined community program. It started out humble, but now packs a plethora of features. It's evolved to where it's mostly based on [Gengar's](https://github.com/bdawg1989) [PokeBot](https://github.com/bdawg1989/PokeBot) project, with many custom additions to it and a brand new self-built GUI.

- *Restart button to reboot the game and load back in to trade with the bot again.*

**GUI DESIGN:**

- *Sleek, clean, stylish, and beautiful. The most gorgeous SysBot you'll ever see.*
