## INTRODUCTION

`ZE FusionBot` is a robust, open-source SysBot.NET fork originally meant specifically for the Discord server, Zeraora's Emporium, hence the 'ZE' in the name. It was originally meant to satisfy the personal needs of the bot owners running exclusively in the server, but it slowly evolved into the mess that it is today.

This bot unites the forks of various other developers - some new, some old, some advanced, some only beginning, and it adds to it, making it now a massively combined community program. It started out humble, but now packs a plethora of features. It's evolved to where it's mostly based on [Gengar's](https://github.com/bdawg1989) [MergeBot](https://github.com/bdawg1989/MergeBot) project.

**Some features include:**
- *Restart button to reboot the game and load back in to trade with the bot again.*
- *Update button to keep up-to-date with my personal releases.*
- *Choose your own permanent Link Trade Code for all trades.*
- *Batch trading, allowing up to 6 trades at once per person.*
- *Trade via PokePaste URLs.*
- *DM embeds for easier and less cluttered bot messages, with cute little gifs attached.*
- *Hidden Trades, where only the species is shown. Sets and files get deleted instantly.*
- *Custom text-only option in case embeds aren't your thing, but still has some flavor.*
- *Generate and trade random VGC teams, or rent them in-game with a code.*
- *Battle-Ready competitive Pokemon trade module, for competitive players.*
- *HOME-Ready trade module to select and trade Pokemon with HOME trackers.*
- *SysDVR integration, to view your Switch live on your PC.*
- *SysBotRemote integration, allowing a GUI controller on PC to control your Switch.*
- *Event trade module to search and trade event/gift Pokemon.*
- *Surprise trade module, which trades a Pokemon randomly, with random stats.*
- *Mystery Egg module to generate an egg for all games with complete randomness.*
- *Auto-Correct, which corrects misspellings and illegal formats to automatically become legal.*
- *Custom UI themes, with more to soon be added.*
- *Drop-down menu to select which game mode you want to use.*
- *Bot Start & Stop embed that keeps bot channels active while displaying the bot's online status.*
- *Announcement module, to send messages to multiple channels and servers at once.*
- *Egg trade support for supported games.*
- *AutoOT, which applies your game's trainer info automatically, unless otherwise specified.*
- *Supports Let's Go, Pikachu & Let's Go, Eevee.*
- *Server Blacklist, to ban a server from using your bot.*
- *Send messages using your bot as the speaker.*
- *Ability to keep track of how many times a user traded with the bots.*
